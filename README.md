I am an undergraduate Computer Science student🎓 at UC Irvine 🏫. I am passionate about both computer science💻 and art 🎨, and am constantly exploring 🧐 ways to combine these two things in my work 📝. In my free time ⏱️, I enjoy playing games 🎮 or watching videos 📺 on technology and art. I find it fascinating 🤯 how these two seemingly different fields can intersect and inspire one another ✨.

### What I'm up to:

- 🛠 &nbsp; Working with Nodejs, Express, React, MongoDB.
